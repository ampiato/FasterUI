# FasterUI

A framework for building beautiful UIs. Pronto!

[Have a look at available components in our Storybook](https://ampiato-fasterui.netlify.app/storybook/?path=/docs/components-button--docs)

## TODOs

- [ ] **Playground** üõù Side-by-side view with code editor and resulting UI where you can mess around.
- [x] **Deploy Storybook** [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) is a great way to test how each component could be configured.
- [ ] **Deploy OpenAPI** OpenAPI serves as an interface specification between backend service and frontend. It would be nice to have an access to it from anywhere.
- [ ] **Client library for ASP.NET** 
- [ ] **Client library for C/C++**
- [ ] **Client library for Java**
- [ ] **Client library for Rust ‚ù§Ô∏è**
- [ ] **Continuous integration to test all the libraries** It should test that all the component libraries are compatible with the latest version of the component specification.
- [ ] **Examples üßê**
- [ ] **Documentation üìö** Anything less than Stripe's documentation is unacceptable.
